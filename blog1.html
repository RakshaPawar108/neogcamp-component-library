        The COVID-19 pandemic came with many challenges in every sector of
        society. Companies had to shift their workforces to virtual platforms in
        order to be able to function smoothly. For this purpose, many companies
        opted for the work-from-home culture in order to keep their businesses
        afloat. However, employees also faced many challenges while working from
        home. In this blog, we discuss some of the challenges faced by employees
        and some effective solutions to make this mode of work more efficient.

          Due to WFH, the work-life balance has been disturbed and the
          boundaries between personal and professional life are blurred.
          Employees working remotely struggle to maintain a proper work-life
          balance and thus have higher stress levels. <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          We can have a small home-office space that separates personal life
          from professional life. We can have a fitness schedule to maintain
          physical health. Practising yoga and meditation can greatly help in
          reducing stress levels. We can also set aside some time to practise
          hobbies to avoid mental burnout. Also, conveying boundaries clearly
          can avoid the culture of a 24/7 work culture.

          Many employees also face internet connectivity issues because they are
          situated in remote areas. Many people are not able to afford
          high-speed internet due to financial issues. <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Companies can provide secure internet facilities like modems to
          connect to company assets. Also, employees can have a network backup
          and avoid the usage of multiple devices over the same internet
          connection.
        </li>

          The biggest issue faced by associates while working from home is the
          problem of infrastructure and asset failure. This issue when raised
          takes some time to be corrected by the proper personnel and thus
          results in delays in the completion of deliverables. <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          The system should be checked at regular intervals to avoid failures.
          Also, the information of asset failure should be conveyed as soon as
          possible so that it can be resolved at the earliest.

          One of the most important WFH challenges is the weak bonding between
          members of a team. The lack of trust between team members can
          sometimes decrease the overall productivity of the team in WFH mode
          since everyone is working remotely. <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          This can be rectified by arranging daily formal meetings of team
          members to keep the team updated on the project status. Also, informal
          meetings of team members can be held once or twice a month to allow
          them to interact with each other on topics unrelated to work. Also,
          teams can engage in some virtual team building fun activities in order
          to know each other better and to be able to trust each other.

          Infrastructure and Data Security issues are of primary concern to any
          organization. There is a threat of data breaches and cyber-attacks
          while working from home. Also, overload on servers is a major issue
          faced by associates. <br />
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Employees should access company data on company authorized assets only
          in order to assure data security. Also, associates should avoid
          unnecessary use of servers and if the server cannot bear the load then
          some of the load can be moved on Private Cloud-based servers.
